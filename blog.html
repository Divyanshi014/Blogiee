                <p class="lower-text">If selecting the right typeface has ever felt overwhelming or slightly 
                    you, perhaps reflecting upon font psychology can offer some clarity. The following science-backed
                    ideas
                    will hopefully inspire some typography decisions that will best suit your project and goals.

                    Which typefaces are easy to read and which aid memory retention? How does one choose a font that
                    aligns
                    with the brand on a psychological level? Which of them boast a personality and what kind? These are
                    just
                    a few questions research seems to have answered for us. Expect a highly condensed, but informative
                    summary of the current findings, so you’ll know when to apply specific typefaces for your intended
                    outcomes</p>

                <img src="/Images/font.jpeg" alt="">
                <p class="lower-text">
                    Before kicking off, as a possible trigger warning, I should mention that I will be using “fonts” and
                    “typefaces” at times interchangeably here — despite the minor differences; namely that the former
                    exists as part of the latter. As this doesn’t exactly seem to twist the science, the takeaways will
                    still apply. Happy learning!
                </p>

                <h1>Basic but important trade-offs</h1>
                <p class="lower-text">
                    Starting with a significant one: fonts that are more difficult to read actually promote memory
                    retention. The harder our brain has to work, the better we can remember content, as it adapts (and
                    rises) to the challenge. Such fonts also help us be less distracted and hold onto our focus in noisy
                    environments.

                    Meanwhile, easy-to-read fonts are processed faster, but encoded in less depth, adding up to a
                    shallower, more fleeting recollection. Completely illegible font types will, of course, push this
                    takeaway way past its limits as people won’t be able to, you know, read a thing.

                    Another caveat to keep in mind is that material presented in more difficult-to-read fonts is enjoyed
                    less. In other words, though they might help with studying and memorising, it all still makes for a
                    shabby experience.

                <h2>The battle of Serif vs Sans-Serif</h2>
                <p class="lower-text"> Let’s put this into a typeface context and pitch one against another, so you can
                    decide which will suit your design better.</p>

                <h4>1) Serifs decrease reading speed, </h4>
                <p class="para">so if you want your audience to spend more time on your
                    content, you
                    can use this to your advantage by picking, for example, Times New Roman, Garamond, Georgia, Didot,
                    or
                    whatever else takes your fancy from the Serif family.</p>

                <h4>2) We can also shift the perspective here.</h4>
                <p class="para">For larger chunks of text, you may want to choose
                    Sans-serif
                    fonts for a speedier read — which also improve accessibility. The 10 percent of the population
                    believed
                    to have dyslexia will likely thank you for going sans to help with reading performance. Those with
                    low
                    vision also seem to prefer sans-serifs according to a research review.</p>

                <h4>3) Serif typefaces significantly increase memory recall.</h4>
                <p class="para">As highlighted before, because they
                    take longer
                    to read and decipher, they can lead to a deeper, more solidified knowledge.

                    If we linger just a bit longer on the topic of recollections, it might also be worth pointing out
                    the
                    role of font sizes and styles. In short, bold content helps us remember better than normal or italic
                    styles, and large font sizes also aid our memory. (Quite possibly nothing new here — but it’s always
                    good to confirm our assumptions, right?)</p>

                <h2 class="typeface">Typefaces and their (many) associated personality traits</h2>
                 <p class="para"> In the same way that colours evoke feelings, moods and personality traits can also be assigned</p>
                <p class="para"> To this end, the Software Usability Research Laboratory (SURL) at Wichita State
                    University tried to
                    understand how people perceive typefaces. They asked participants to complete a questionnaire
                    detailing
                    which characteristics describe and resonate with different fonts, in their opinion.</p>

                <h4 class="serif">1) Serif typefaces scored the highest on traits such as “stable, practical, mature,
                    and formal”.</h4>
                <p class="para">
                    On an amusing note, satirical texts printed in Times New Roman are perceived as funnier and angrier
                    than
                    those written in (the Sans-serif) Arial, possibly because the former is seen as professional and
                    formal.
                    Print publications in general also tend to use serif fonts due to perceived (more enjoyable)
                    readability
                    and more refined aesthetics.</p>

                        


                <img src="/Images/sans.png" alt="">

                <h4> 2) Sans-serifs did not score extremely high or low on any of the personality traits listed, 
                    makesthem both natural and all-purpose in a sense</h4>
                <p class="para">They can also be seen as fresh, high-quality, smart,
                    readable, minimal, and crisp.</p>

                <p class="blue para"> 
                    Most companies use Sans-serif typefaces (such as Helvetica, Gill Sans, Futura) on
                    their packaging,
                    advertising, and websites due to their clarity and legibility in both small and large font sizes.
                    They
                    are also more prevalent in the digital aether as they tend to render more crisply on a range of
                    screen
                    sizes.</p>

                   

                <img src="Images/youthful.png" alt="">

                <h4> 3) Script fonts </h4>
                <p class="para">were seen as youthful, happy, creative, rebellious, feminine, casual, and cuddly in this
                    study. Meanwhile, in a 1982 research paper they were specifically described as being more elegant.
                </p>

                <h4>4) Modern Display</h4>
                <p class="para"> tend to be associated with traits such as masculinity, assertion, rudeness,
                sadness, and coarseness.</p>

                <h4>5) Monospaced </h4>
                <p class="para">
                    were most described as dull, plain, unimaginative, and conforming.

                    Based on a 2018 study, handwritten fonts increase consumers’ attachment to products as they create a
                    sense of human presence. Those who experience loneliness might also be more prone to building
                    emotional connections with products, since they have a higher tendency to “humanize” items. This
                    applies stronger to cases where the consumer doesn’t already feel a sense of attachment to the
                    brand, though.

                    Finally, as a general rule, “friendly” typefaces tend to be simple and imperfect, displaying rounded
                    features (such as everyone’s favourite, Comic Sans). Those showing balance and moderation in their
                    anatomy (think weight, proportion, and thick-to-thin transitions) are seen as “professional.”</p>

                <h2>Carrying and influencing meaning</h2>
                <p class="para">
                    Since typefaces alone are already associated with certain feelings and messages, it
                    wise to choose traits that resemble your context. Fonts can not only convey, but also influence 
                    meaning of objects, and thus how users perceive them.

                    Another important point to consider is that the font’s own meaning should not clash with the brand’s
                    identity. If there is no visual consistency across the two, it makes the brand harder to remember,
                    so picking one that fits the company’s tone and purpose is a long-term investment. Products are also
                    chosen more often when the brand name appears in an “appropriate” typeface.

                    For example, in a study, ads for a “slim” phone performed better with a font that was perceived to
                    be slimmer, and those for an “elegant” phone were more successful when written in an elegant, script
                    font.</p>

                <img src="/Images/Hisab.jpeg" alt="" class="hisab">
                <p class="para">

                <h2> Below are also a handful of style characteristics to keep in
                </h2>
                <img src="/Images/add.png" alt="">

                <p class="para">It’s important to note that the impact of the typeface itself is separate from the
                    effect of the font’s colour used to communicate the brand’s personality. Fun fact: the shape of a
                    font can convey specific taste expectations, though — rounded for sweet and angular for sour.
                    Delicious.</p>

                <h2>Keeping it natural</h2>

                <p class="para">In a similar study published by the Journal of Marketing, researchers investigated the
                    types of
                    emotional responses evoked in consumers by a font’s design characteristics.

                    The findings showed that naturalness had the biggest impact on creating enjoyable and engaging
                    experiences. You may rightfully be wondering what passes as a natural trait. This refers to the
                    irregular, organic, spontaneous styles that some fonts resemble, rather than a more contained and
                    artificial geometric form.

                    Additional findings included the notion that while elaborate fonts came across as intimidating,
                    harmony
                    made them more comforting.</p>
